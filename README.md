# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, a repo inspired by the need to migrate to another pc and the lazyness to install everything manually from scratch.

Features my configs for:

* Vim
* Tmux
* Ranger
* Bash

Also a script to symlink everything to `HOME` and another one to fresh install my setup.

# Highlights

* Some very useful aliases, look out for my [venv-utils](https://github.com/masher2/venv-utils).
* Very clean grey and blue vim and tmux themes which work perfectly together (Pics comming soon).
* A vim inspired current dir bash prompt.

# Credits

I'll be adding credits to everything I steal from the internet soon.
