# Theme changer config file
#
# The config consists of a header and a list of images' basenames indented by
# 4 spaces. The headers are "bright" for wallpapers to match with the light
# theme and "shine" for the wallpapers to match with the dark theme, and must be
# a blank line after the last filename.
# 
# The config is formatted as follows:
# header:
#     wallpaper.png
#     wallpaper 2.jpg
